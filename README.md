# Responsive Multi-Page Website with Bootstrap

## Overview

This project involves creating a responsive, mobile-friendly website using HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap CSS Library. The website consists of multiple pages and features a custom CSS animation to enhance visual appeal. The design focuses on ensuring a seamless user experience across different screen sizes, maintaining consistency in structure, and adhering to best practices in web development.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website adapts to both desktop and mobile views using Bootstrap 5.
- **Custom CSS Animation**: A 20-second (or infinite) animation that modifies at least 3 CSS properties.
- **Clean Code Structure**: HTML and CSS are validated to current web standards, with no inline or embedded styles. All styling is contained in an external CSS file.
- **Navigation Bar**: Each page contains a navigation bar with links styled as buttons. The current page’s link is disabled but remains visible, providing clear user feedback.
- **Consistency Across Pages**: Common elements like the header, navigation bar, and footer are consistent across all pages.

## Page Structure

### Header
- Includes the website title, developer's name, and a custom CSS animation.

### Navigation Bar
- Links to multiple pages, with the current page’s link disabled.
- Buttons-style navigation with a hover/focus animation effect.

### Main Content
- Supports multiple themes, including reflections on personal goals, hobbies, stories, or blog-style content.
- The content is presented with a responsive layout using Bootstrap’s grid system.

### Footer
- Contains a copyright notice with the current year.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Semantic markup for building the web pages.
- **CSS3**: Custom styles and animations, ensuring a polished visual experience.
- **Bootstrap 5**: For responsive layout and design elements like grid systems, navbars, and buttons.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Home page of the website.
- `page2.html`: Secondary page with additional content.
- `assign1.css`: External CSS file for all custom styles and animations.

## Best Practices
- Case-sensitive file names are used to ensure compatibility with Unix-based servers.
- All styling is done using external CSS files, and inline styles are avoided.
- Validated HTML and CSS files to meet web standards, ensuring cross-browser compatibility.

## Hosting & Deployment
The website is hosted on a live server using SFTP for file transfers. It is designed to be accessible via both desktop and mobile browsers, showcasing responsive design elements tailored to different device screen sizes.
