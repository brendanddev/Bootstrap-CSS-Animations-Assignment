                    <p>
                        Throughout my first semester at Mohawk College, I had a really good time. Although I had been out of school for two years, it was like a breath of fresh air to get back into the routine of things. Throughout my two years off, I reflected on things. What I felt I wanted to do with my life. I also had the opportunity of working full time, saving some money, and seeing how real life was. But back to my first semester, I developed some valuable skills I did not take for granted.

                <p>
                    In my first semester, I finally participated in a class that focused on programming. I studied both Python and HTML & CSS! Both courses went very well, in which I got a mark I was really happy with. I put a lot of time and effort into both of the courses and ended up learning a lot from both courses too. Coming into the first semester, I wanted to learn to code. It has always interested me, and I was so happy I could finally learn beyond just a textbook. I enjoyed both of my proffesors, both were nice and helped me get to where I wanted to be in the course.
