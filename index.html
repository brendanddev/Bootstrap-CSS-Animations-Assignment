                    <p>
                        Before coming to Mohawk, I had many goals I planned to achieve. My first goal consisted of learning how to program, and learning how code works. I have always been very interested in programming making my goals more applicable to the outcome I plan to achieve. My second goal consists of becoming fluent in Java, JavaScript, Bootstrap, and one of the 'C' languages. I have always been creative, and have always had the hope of making something, preferably a software, website, or video game.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Just to introduce myself a bit, my name is Brendan Dileo, and I am currently in the 559 Software Development program at Mohawk College as this is my second semester. I am very passionate about technology, whether it be computers, building or fixing them. In addition to computers, I love collecting technology, and modding technology like phones, tablets, or other items. Coding has also always been a passion of mine despite not learning a language until my first year. I love the concept of coding, and making things. I am also very passionate about video games, whether it be playing them, or collecting them. My favorite video game is either The Last Of Us, Black Ops One, LOZ Majoras Mask, or LOZ Breath Of The Wild. My favourite console aside from my PC is either the Xbox 360, Nintendo DS, or Nintendo 3DS.

                    <p>
                        In the future, I want to create. I really would like to start something meaningful. A passion of mine has always been helping those who struggle with Mental Health. So ideally if I could incorporate my passion for technology, and programming into my passion for helping those who struggle with mental health, that would be awesome! Additionally, I want to use my passion for coding, programming, and technology as a whole to help people in need. I know it's a pretty broad goal, but this is because I am not too sure where I want to go with it yet, but I know that is something I'd like to do!
